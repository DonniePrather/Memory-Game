## About

This project was completed by me as part of the requirements for obtaining Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree.
The objective was to create a memory game and keep track of the time and number of moves requred to find all matches.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Install

1. Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/DonniePrather/MemoryGame

2. Load index.htm in browser.

## Play

1. Click any two cards to find a match.
2. If you find a match the cards will stay face up.
3. If the 2 cards do not match they will flip back over.
4. Once you have found all the matches all 16 cards will be face up.
5. You Win!
